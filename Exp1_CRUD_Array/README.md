# CRUD Program in JavaScript

## Aim

To develop a simple program in JavaScript (Node.js) that performs **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on an array.

## Steps

1. Created a JavaScript file `index.js`.
2. Used the `readline` module to take user input.
3. Implemented:
   - Create → add items to the array
   - Read → display current items
   - Update → modify an item by index
   - Delete → remove an item by index
4. Displayed a menu to repeatedly perform operations until Exit.

## Expected Output

- User can **add, view, update, and delete items** in the array.
- Program shows a menu each time until the user chooses Exit.
